**     EUPAN ---- Eukaryotic PAN-genome analysis     **
*******************************************************

Introduction

Pan-genome analyses of bacteria and archaea are routinely carried out to interpret the within-species variation. However, eukaryotic pan-genome analyses are limited by the large sizes and high complexities of their genomes. Therefore we develloped a new strategy ---- EUPAN for eukaryotic pan-genome analysis. EUPAN enables accurately detection of gene presence-absence variations (gene PAVs) at sequencing depth of ~20x for eukaryotic large genomes and can be directly applied to current large re-sequencing projects primarily aimming at Single nucleotide variations (SNVs).

We proposed EUPAN strategy primarily in the 3,000 rice genome projects. EUPAN utilizes a "map-to-pan" strategy to determine gene PAVs of each individual (see the following figure). EUPAN strategy involves (1) the parallel quality control of raw sequencing data; (2) de novo assembly of individual genomes; (3) construction of pan-genome sequences based on the de novo assemblies and available reference genomes; (4) gene annotation of the pan-genome sequences; (5) determination of PAVs based on mapping individual reads to pan-genome sequences; and (6) PAV-based pan-genome analysis.

Eukaryotic large genome studies always involve big data and many tools and softwares and require very careful parameter selection process. Therefore, we also provide the EUPAN toolbox to accelarate this kind of study. The toolbox provides tools working on a single machine and tools working on supercomputer based on LSF system (in which, users use "bsub" to submit jobs).


Installation

   Requirements
     1) R 3.1 or later (https://www.r-project.org/)
        R is utilized for visulization and statistical tests in EUPAN toolbox. Please install R first and make sure R and Rscript are under your PATH. 
     2) R packages
        Several R packages are needed including ggplot2, reshape2 and ape packages. Follow the Installation step 3) or you can install the packages by yourself.

   Installation procedures
     1) Download the EUPAN toolbox here.
     2) Uncompress the EUPAN toolbox package.
          tar zxvf EUPAN-v1.0.tar.gz
     3) Install necessary R packages.
          cd EUPAN
          Rscript installRPac
     4) Compile necessary tools.
          make
        You will find executable files: ccov and bam2cov in bin/ directory.
     5) Add bin/ to PATH and add lib/ to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
        To do this, add the following text to ~/.bash_profile
           export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/EUPAN/bin:
           export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/EUPAN/lib/:
           export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/path/to/EUPAN/lib/:
        and run
           source ~/.bash_profile
     6) Test if EUPAN toolbox is installed successfully.
